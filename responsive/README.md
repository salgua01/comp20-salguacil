#Lab 4: Responsive - Sandra Alguacil

Time spent:  3.5 hours

Description: .css style sheet to make an image respond to the size of the browser. The image is added in the class defined in css instead of adding it in html directly. In the class, I defined the size of the image, and then in each media query, I chose the starting point of the image so that it showed a different part according to the pixels of the browser.
