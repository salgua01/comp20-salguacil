# SECURITY REPORT README.md
Sandra Alguacil
## Implemented aspects
I found three security issues and documented them in a plan HTML page. In this page, every aspect of the process of finding this issues has been documented, including screenshots of either the results or the commands that I used.
## Collaborators
I discussed this assignment with the person whose code I was checking, Julie Yeung. We shared the weak parts of our code and did some research together to find ways to break it.
## Time spent
I have approximately spent three hours on this assignment: one hour to find the issues and two report them in html format.
