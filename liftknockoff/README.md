Assignment 2 -- Sandra Alguacil

Hours spent: 9
Collaborators: none
Problematic implementations:
	-Sometimes, it shows distances that are clearly wrong. For example, one marker that is closer from the user than another displays a bigger number. 
Description: 
	-Webpage that retrieves the location of the user and displays the location of other users who are the "opposite". In this case, I am a passenger, so the page displays the location of vehicles and the Weinermobile. When the user clicks on any marker, an information window will be opened, informing them of the distance to other users (in clase they click on themselves) or to themselves (in case they click on others). This webpage should work no matter if the user is a passenger or a vehicle.
