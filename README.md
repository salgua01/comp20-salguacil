### What's the purpose of this Git repository?
Store all the work that I've been doing during the course so that it can be corrected and seen by others.
### What was your favourite assignment and why?
My favourite assignment was the second one. I loved creating the client side of a ride app because it was a great way to see how an app that everyone uses work. I preferred this one to the third one because I was able to see more clearly what I was doing. Thanks to these two assignments, I discovered that I am more of a frond-end person.
### How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have grown a lot. My only programming background was Comp11, so I was not very confident about my skills. However, I was very interested form day one, because I really liked the environment of the class and doing so many assignments and labs helped me engage rapidly. Evn though I don't think this is something I will do in the future, this class has helped me discover how things I use every day work.
### What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
As I've said in the last question, I think that the most important thing I've learned is how apps I use work. Now I know why sometimes we can't add "special characters" to our usernames (to avoid XSS) or how some webpages use the services of others (for example Uber using GoogleMaps).
### Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I don't think I will use the back-end knowledge in the future, even though I appreciate knowing a bit about it. However, I would love to learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript because it will be helpful to my own good-looking webpage.
